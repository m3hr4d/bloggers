Project Goals and Requirements
===============================

Development Workflow Guidelines
---------------------------
1. Feature Implementation Process:
   - Always check existing features in the project before starting new work
   - If a feature exists:
     * Review its current implementation
     * Enhance/complete it if necessary
     * Document improvements made
   - If feature doesn't exist:
     * Move to implementing the next feature in priority
     * Follow the detailed specifications below
   - Track progress in this document
   - Update feature status regularly

2. Status Tracking System
   Status Indicators:
   [üî¥] Not Started (0%)
   [üü°] In Progress (1-99%)
   [üü¢] Completed (100%)
   [‚≠ê] Completed with Enhancements
   [üîÑ] Needs Review
   [üõ†Ô∏è] Needs Maintenance

   Priority Levels:
   [P0] Critical Path
   [P1] High Priority

Important Note on Security Features
--------------------------------
Security features are intentionally deferred for the initial development phase. This includes:
- Two-factor authentication
- Advanced password hashing
- CSRF protection
- Advanced session management
- API security measures
